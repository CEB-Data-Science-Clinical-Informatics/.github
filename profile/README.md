## Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics

Established in 1989 as the Clinical Epidemiology Unit within the Dean's office, the CEB has since expanded its scope in evidence-based medical research and its role within the Faculty of Medicine at Ramathibodi Hospital, attaining department status in 2004. By the end of 2019, Mahidol University further elevated the section to the Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics.

The department initiated its international PhD program in clinical epidemiology in 2008, followed by an MSc program in 2013, both taught in English. In 2016, the CEB introduced new PhD and MSc programs in Data Science for Health Care, welcoming its first cohort in 2017. These programs have evolved to encompass Data Science for Healthcare and Clinical Informatics by 2020.

Currently, the department boasts 33 full-time staff, 6 joint-departmental members, and 3 guest lecturers, forming an experienced team with diverse expertise in clinical epidemiology, biostatistics, and clinical research. [^1]

## CEB Data Warehouse Project

The CEB Data Warehouse Project, established in 2010, focuses on constructing data warehouses for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) from the Ramathibodi hospital information system. These data warehouses cover a range of conditions, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and heart failure, and are updated quarterly.

Each data warehouse working group consists of a cohort coordinator, a physician/epidemiologist, a data scientist, a statistician, and a pharmacist/data engineer from the Data Health for Analysis Section. The National Research Council of Thailand funds this project under the title "Research Cluster on Evidence Synthesis, Treatment Managements of Non-communicable Diseases, and Dry Eye Disease" (Grant number N42A640323).
